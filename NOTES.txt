For difficulty estimation, we'll start with a simple SVM.
For each attack we'll generate a data point containing the attacker info, defender info, and a 0 or 1 depending on who won.

Personal stats to use:
logins
useractivity
attackswon
xantaken
exttaken
networth
traveltimes
refills
medicalitemsused
awards
age
last action (measure in days ago)
maximum life

Steps needed for implementation:
Get attacksfull at the start for all players?
Write rate limit-aware personal stats update
Update schema to add personal stats to database
Update personal stats for all existing players
Write function to aggregate above data into a weka-ready dataset
Write function to train a classifier based on dataset
Write function to classify targets based on classifier
Evaluate effectiveness of classifier and potentially try different technique
Write frontend code to visualize difficulties for previously unknown targets using classifier
